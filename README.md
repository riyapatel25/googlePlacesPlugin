# Inspiration

As avid explorers of new places, we often found ourselves spending considerable time scrolling through reviews to find places that meet our specific needs. Whether we were searching for a dog-friendly restaurant or a quiet cafe for work, the process was tedious. We realized that many others face similar challenges, and that's when the idea for our ChatGPT plugin was born. We wanted to create a solution that would intelligently analyze reviews and provide personalized recommendations, saving users valuable time and effort.

# Stack We Have Used

1. Python
2. Open AI
3. Flask
4. Google Maps API

# How We Built It

The plugin is built using ChatGPT and integrates with the Google Places API to retrieve reviews of places based on user queries. We developed a methodology to analyze the context of reviews and identify key attributes that align with user preferences. The plugin then curates a list of places that match the user's criteria and presents them in an easy-to-understand format. If the plugin lacks sufficient information to provide accurate recommendations, it will ask the user for additional context or details. Users can also request new options if they're not satisfied with the initial recommendations.
